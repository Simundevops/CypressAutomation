# Calculator Automation with Cypress
This Project is built for one assignement related to SDET interveiw.

## Context

Imagine you’re a SDET Engineer working for a team at Google and the engineering
team has just built a calculator tool that shows up when you search for the term
“calculator”.

## Overview
Goal is to build an automated end to end test suite that tests the functionality
of this calculator component on Google. For this challenge imagine the calculator
only has the buttons 0123456789.=+-×÷AC/CE (all the buttons in the picture below
that aren’t blurred out). We use Cypress.io as our automation tool, but feel free to
use whatever automation tool you are most familiar with to build your end-to-end
automation tests.
